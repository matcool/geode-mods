# Reference Image

Adds a button to the Edit tab of the editor to anchor a reference image to a selected object.

This is useful for tracing art, for example.

### No, this will not generate the image as objects.

Thanks to [alkatreize](user:5625235) for the button texture, and [mels](user:10436658) for the idea.
