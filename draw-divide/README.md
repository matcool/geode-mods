# Draw Divide

This mod makes the game only render at your native refresh rate, even when you have an unlocked FPS, helping performance, specially for those with worse GPUs.

This works by only rendering the game at 60fps (or whatever your refresh rate is), while still running all the logic to whatever fps you set the game to.

Meaning you get the benefit of fps bypass (lower input delay) while also not lagging as much due to rendering the game at such high fps.

Note: Mods like [Click Between Frames](mod:syzzi.click_between_frames) and [Click on Steps](mod:zmx.cbf-lite) may offer the same benefit with greater perfomance.

Note: The vanilla FPS counter will display the "TPS" and not the visual FPS count.

## Usage

This mod is intended to be used with FPS bypass, such as the one included in the game.

Set it to a high value to gain input precision while this mod keeps the visual FPS the same, helping performance.
