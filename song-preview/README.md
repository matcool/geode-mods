# Advanced Song Preview

Play locally downloaded songs with their waveforms and an easy ui for picking a start offset.

Waveform code based off [config's code for his 2.1 mod](https://github.com/cgytrus/EditorWaveform). Thanks config boy

To use this mod, go into the editor and press play when picking a custom song. There you can
seek the song by clicking on the waveform, and pick a start offset by dragging the cursor on top.
